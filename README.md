Learning typography


## TYPES
- **Serif**
> The serifs are small ornaments located at the ends of each letter and are intended to provide greater fluidity in reading. These details make one letter practically connect to another.

- **Sans-serif**
> Fonts without the serif usually look more streamlined. They do not have the ornament that provides fluidity, in contrast can make the text lighter.

- **Monospace**
> As the name says, fonts of fixed spacing, or monospace, always have the same measure between the characters, that is, they do not have kerning. Kerning is an automatic adjustment that approximates characters that would be visually distanced by their shapes.

- **Coursive**
> They are fountains that simulate a handmade text, with calligraphic letters. Reading this type of font may vary and is usually not the easiest - it is not recommended for paragraph texts.

- **FANTASY**
> They are the sources that do not fit the other rules and can have different aspects. When used, they usually stylize titles or decorative elements.

- **ASCENDANT** | **Height** that some _lowercase_ **letters** reach, being able to _equal_ the height of **versal**.

- **DESCENDANT** | _Length_ that some letters reach for the _bottom of the baseline_.

- **Baseline** | **Axis** that _aligns all characters_.

- **SaliÃªnca** | **Curves** at _the base_ of letters that extend beyond the _baseline_, used to _balance the text_. If the types were not positioned like this, they would appear to be wobbling along a text.
